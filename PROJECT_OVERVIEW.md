### 3. Analysis Tasks (`task.py`)

#### **Document Verification** (`verification`)
- Validates document type and quality
- Ensures sufficient financial data is present
- Assesses readiness for analysis

### 4. API Interface (`main.py`)

#### **FastAPI Web Server**
- RESTful API interface for document uploads
- File validation and processing
- Comprehensive error handling
- Structured JSON responses

#### **Key Endpoints**

**GET /** - Health check endpoint
```json
{
  "message": "Financial Document Analyzer API is running"
}
```

**POST /analyze** - Document analysis endpoint
- **Input**: PDF file upload + analysis query
- **Output**: Comprehensive financial analysis report
- **Features**:
  - File format validation (PDF only)
  - Size limits (50MB maximum)
  - Automatic file cleanup
  - Detailed logging

## Workflow Process

### 1. Document Upload & Validation
1. User uploads PDF financial document via API
2. System validates file format, size, and integrity
3. Document is temporarily saved for processing

### 2. Sequential Analysis Pipeline
The CrewAI crew processes the document through four sequential stages:

1. **Verification Phase**: Document validator ensures file contains valid financial data
2. **Analysis Phase**: Financial analyst extracts and analyzes key financial metrics
3. **Investment Phase**: Investment advisor formulates investment recommendations
4. **Risk Phase**: Risk assessor conducts comprehensive risk evaluation

### 3. Response Generation
- All agent outputs are compiled into structured response
- Comprehensive analysis report is generated
- Temporary files are automatically cleaned up
- Results are returned as JSON response

## Data Flow

```
PDF Upload → Validation → Text Extraction → Agent Analysis → Report Generation → Response
     ↓            ↓            ↓              ↓              ↓            ↓
File Check → Format Check → PDF Reader → CrewAI Crew → JSON Compile → API Response
```
